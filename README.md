<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The SCP Database was built by 4 Junior Developers enrolled onto the Code Nation 'Master: Coding' 3 month course.

Inspired by the web-based collaborative project of the same name, the database holds information about various anomalous or supernatural items including name, classication, description and location.

Within the website's fictional setting, the SCP Foundation is a secret organization entrusted by governments around the globe to contain and study anomalous individuals, entities, locations, objects, and phenomena operating outside the bounds of natural law (referred to as "SCP objects", or colloquially as "SCPs"). If left uncontained, the objects would pose a direct threat to human life and humanity's perceptions of reality and normalcy.

The existence of SCPs is withheld from the public to prevent mass panic and to allow human civilization to function normally. When an SCP is discovered, the SCP Foundation deploys agents either to collect and transport the SCP to a Foundation facility, or to contain it at its location of discovery if transport is not possible. Once SCPs are contained, they are studied by Foundation scientists. Test subjects acquired by the Foundation (referred to as D-class) are used to interact with dangerous SCPs due to the danger posed by those SCPs and the expendability of the D-class.

The SCP Foundation maintains documentation for all of the SCPs in its custody, which can include or link to related reports and files. These documents describe the SCPs and include instructions for keeping them safely contained.

The story behind the database:

* A foolhardy SCP employee has left his login details written down on a sticky note, so anyone can access the database...
* The newly founded United Kingdom facility has begun to track and contain SCP subjects, segregating them by location

A list of commonly used resources that we found helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.


### Built With
This project was built using the following frameworks and services:

* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [SQL](https://www.iso.org/standard/63555.html)
* [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)

The build was organised using Trello, with version control managed within GitHub and then hosted on Heroku.
